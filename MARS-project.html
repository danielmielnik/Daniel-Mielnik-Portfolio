                <h1>Project Brief</h1>
                <p>As part of the Metropolitan Aerospace Rocketry Society (MARS), my five-person team, Yappasaurus Rex, designed, 
                    built, and launched YAREX, a model rocket powered by a G-class solid propellant engine. The process began with 
                    conceptual design in OpenRocket, where we refined the fin layout (inspired by the Saab 35 Draken) and optimized 
                    the nose cone for aerodynamics. We then manufactured the rocket using a reinforced cardboard body tube, 3D-printed 
                    nose cone, laser-cut balsa fins, and a custom avionics bay. Despite facing fitment issues with the avionics during 
                    competition day, we adapted quickly with on-the-spot fixes and successfully launched on December 20, 2024. The 
                    rocket reached a maximum altitude of 439.3 m, deployed its parachute correctly, and was safely recovered. Post-flight 
                    data analysis allowed us to compare actual performance with simulations, highlighting the effects of weather and drag 
                    on altitude and velocity predictions.</p>

                <h2>
                    Rocket Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The design phase of YAREX began with aerodynamic modeling and stability analysis using OpenRocket. We focused 
                    on ensuring the rocket would achieve a safe and predictable flight while also incorporating unique design elements. 
                    The fins, inspired by the Saab 35 Draken’s double-delta wing, provided a stable center of pressure location without 
                    adding unnecessary mass. We iterated through multiple fin shapes before settling on this design, which offered both 
                    structural simplicity and aerodynamic stability. Similarly, the nose cone underwent a series of trial-and-error 
                    refinements before we finalized an ellipsoid shape. This design minimized drag while ensuring the weight remained 
                    low, an important factor in maximizing altitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond these primary aerodynamic surfaces, we also paid close attention to the rocket’s internal balance. A 
                    transition tube was designed with added volume to house the avionics system, while also shifting the center of 
                    gravity upward to improve stability. This balance between center of gravity and center of pressure was carefully 
                    managed throughout the design process. CAD models of the avionics bay were created to check fitment and integration
                    with the rocket body. These early design efforts ensured that when it came time to build the rocket, we had a 
                    well-thought-out plan that blended performance, functionality, and structural integrity.

                <p>
                    Once the design was locked in, we began manufacturing the rocket components. The body tube was fabricated from 
                    pre-cut cardboard reinforced with epoxy, ensuring durability while keeping weight low. The fins were precision 
                    laser-cut from balsa wood and carefully sanded to a tapered profile to reduce drag. After being slotted into the 
                    body tube, they were secured with epoxy fillets to withstand the stresses of flight. The nose cone was 3D printed 
                    and smoothed with sanding to achieve a snug fit and seamless aerodynamic transition with the main body. These steps 
                    gave us a sturdy, flight-ready airframe.

            <div class="proj_content">
                <p>
                    Attention then shifted to the recovery and avionics systems. The parachute system was assembled with a nylon parachute, 
                    Kevlar shock cord, and fireproof wadding to prevent damage during deployment. The avionics bay was designed as a modular 
                    unit housed within the transition tube, incorporating a PCB and GPS mount. While the bay was initially intended to be 
                    press-fit, we encountered issues with fitment tolerances, leading us to modify the mounting method later. For the 
                    finishing touches, we hand-painted the rocket with a metallic base coat, gradient coloring, and a reptilian scale 
                    pattern — a design that set YAREX apart visually while showcasing the team’s creativity and attention to detail.

                    Launch Day
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Competition day presented both challenges and successes. During final assembly, we discovered that the avionics 
                    bay did not fit properly due to incorrect screw hole tolerances in the 3D print. To adapt, we improvised by 
                    securing the bay with screws and hot glue to stabilize the PCB and GPS. Additionally, the transition tube was too 
                    tight, requiring on-the-spot sanding to ensure it could separate correctly during ejection. These last-minute 
                    adjustments highlighted the importance of testing component fits thoroughly before launch and the value of being 
                    able to problem-solve quickly under pressure. Despite these obstacles, the team remained calm, collaborative, and 
                    efficient in resolving each issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After resolving the fitment problems, the rocket underwent safety inspections, which it passed without issue. 
                    We then carefully loaded the G131 motor, securing it with retention hardware, and double-checked the recovery 
                    system to ensure the parachute was packed correctly. With the rocket mounted on the rail, the ignition cables 
                    were attached, and the countdown began under the supervision of the Launch Control Officer. When the igniter 
                    was fired, YAREX roared to life, accelerating rapidly and reaching an apogee of 439.3 m. The ejection charge 
                    fired as intended, deploying the parachute at apogee and ensuring a smooth, controlled descent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Watching the rocket return safely to the ground was a rewarding moment, confirming that all our hard work in design, 
                    manufacturing, and last-minute problem-solving had paid off. The rocket showed no structural damage upon recovery, 
                    and the avionics data provided valuable insight into the flight profile. Post-flight analysis revealed discrepancies 
                    between simulations and real performance, largely due to environmental conditions like wind and cold temperatures, 
                    which reduced motor efficiency and increased drag. Despite this, the flight was a complete success — both technically 
                    and as a learning experience in teamwork, resilience, and hands-on rocketry.

                <h1>What I Learned</h1>
                <p>
                    This project gave me valuable hands-on experience with the full rocketry design cycle; from CAD modeling and 
                    simulation to manufacturing, assembly, and launch operations. I learned how critical precision and tolerances are,
                     especially in 3D-printed components like the avionics bay, where even small misalignments can create last-minute 
                     issues. I also gained experience in troubleshooting under pressure, adapting quickly with practical fixes to keep 
                     the rocket flight-ready. Working in a small, collaborative team of five reinforced the importance of sharing 
                     responsibilities and overlapping contributions to avoid gaps in the workflow. Finally, analyzing discrepancies 
                     between simulation and real-world data taught me the importance of accounting for environmental conditions like 
                     wind and temperature in aerospace design. Overall, the project strengthened my technical skills in design and 
                     manufacturing, while also sharpening my teamwork, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities.
