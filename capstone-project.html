                <h1>Project Brief</h1>
                <p>In the AER 814 capstone project, my team of 13 members designed a clean-sheet multi-role Search and Rescue (SAR) 
                    aircraft for the Canadian government, with added flexibility to serve as a civilian passenger and cargo transport 
                    for remote regions. The design emphasized low operating cost, long endurance, STOL capability, and cabin efficiency, 
                    making it competitive with existing SAR platforms while tailored to Canada’s unique mission needs. I contributed as 
                    CAD lead while also supporting aerodynamics and structural design tasks, helping guide the development of our digital 
                    mock-up and ensuring consistency across subsystems. Through market analysis, conceptual design iterations, and 
                    technical trade studies, we delivered a versatile and robust configuration — and our work was recognized when our team’s 
                    final design earned 1st place in the class competition.</p>

                    Market Anlysis
                </h2>
                <p>
                    At the start of the project, my role was to conduct market research to establish a baseline for our aircraft’s 
                    mission requirements. I studied existing aircraft that are already successful in search and rescue operations, 
                    focusing on their capabilities, strengths, and limitations. I chose three aircraft for comparison: the Airbus 
                    CC-295 Kingfisher, the Viking DHC-6 Twin Otter, and the Boeing V-22 Osprey. Each offered something different—short 
                    take-off and landing performance, rugged adaptability, or vertical takeoff and landing flexibility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By analyzing these aircraft, I was able to identify which features were most valuable to our mission, such as 
                    operating in challenging environments, carrying critical payloads, and reaching remote or confined areas. This 
                    analysis helped me define clear performance goals for our design and gave our team a foundation to build on. 
                    Ultimately, I used these insights to recommend that our aircraft should combine versatility with efficiency, 
                    ensuring it could meet Canada’s unique SAR needs.

                    Conceptual Design
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Once the market analysis was complete, I moved into conceptual design. I created several iterations of our aircraft 
                    based on lessons learned from competitors and discussions within the team. Early concepts tested ideas like a 
                    high-swept wing with turboprops, a box-wing amphibious aircraft, and a high-mounted tapered wing with a rear 
                    cargo ramp. Each design explored a different way of balancing aerodynamics, mission flexibility, and practicality 
                    for SAR operations.

            </div>
            <div class="proj_content">
                <p>
                    As we refined the concepts, we began eliminating features that didn’t suit the mission. For example, the box-wing 
                    concept improved efficiency but introduced unnecessary complexity, while the T-tail designs helped reduce turbulence 
                    \effects. The final design focused on stability, simplicity, and ruggedness by using a high wing, rear cargo ramp, 
                    and relocating the landing gear under the engines for better protection on unpaved surfaces. My work on these 
                    concepts helped narrow down the configuration that best met our requirements.

                    Wing Sizing
                </h2>
                <p>
                    One of my biggest technical contributions was in wing sizing. I worked closely with a teammate to determine the 
                    geometry of the main wing, and to make the process more efficient, I developed a MATLAB app. This tool allowed 
                    us to dynamically adjust parameters like span, root chord, tip chord, and taper while instantly calculating values 
                    such as aspect ratio, lift and drag, and mean aerodynamic chord. It even provided estimates of fuel storage and 
                    aircraft range, which gave us a deeper understanding of trade-offs in wing design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using this tool, I helped optimize the wing for our mission needs. The final design featured a span of 87 feet, 
                    a root chord of 10 feet, and a tip chord of 5 feet, giving us an aspect ratio of 10 and a wing area of 750 m². 
                    The lift and drag curves showed strong cruise efficiency, although they also highlighted the need for high-lift 
                    devices to achieve lower takeoff speeds and meet STOL requirements. This process gave me hands-on experience with 
                    how design choices directly affect performance.

                    DMU Setup
                </h2>
                <p>
                    As the CAD lead, I was responsible for setting up the Digital Mock-Up (DMU) in CATIA V5. This involved creating an 
                    organized and flexible environment that the entire team could use consistently. I followed Bombardier’s guidelines 
                    for DMU setup and created a clear hierarchy of skeletons, masterlines, structural groups, and analysis sections. I 
                    also centralized all files using OneDrive so that everyone had access to the latest versions, reducing the risk of 
                    errors and making collaboration much easier.

            <div class="proj_content">
                <p>
                    Beyond the masterlines, I created several critical structural elements such as the fuselage framework, cabin structure, 
                    and cargo door system. I also helped refine the aircraft through multiple design iterations, updating the cockpit, 
                    cargo systems, and tail as requirements evolved. One of my key tasks was designing the rear cargo ramp, which was 
                    reinforced to handle loads while also supporting SKAD drops and paratrooper deployment. These contributions helped 
                    bring the aircraft from concept sketches to a detailed, functional 3D model.

                <h1>What I Learned</h1>
                <p>
                    Working on this project with a team of 13 taught me how important collaboration and consensus-building are in 
                    engineering design. With so many perspectives and ideas on the table, it wasn’t always easy to agree on a single 
                    path forward. Through discussions, compromises, and focusing on the mission requirements, I learned how to listen 
                    to different viewpoints, present trade-offs clearly, and help the group align on uniform decisions. This experience 
                    showed me that good design is as much about teamwork and communication as it is about technical skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Leading the CAD team was another major learning experience. At first, I had the instinct to take too much 
                    responsibility myself, but I quickly realized the value of delegation and trust. By sharing tasks and keeping 
                    communication open, I was able to manage the workload more effectively and give team members the chance to contribute 
                    their strengths. This balance between leadership and collaboration helped me grow my ability to manage technical 
                    projects while staying focused on team efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I came to appreciate the critical role that organization plays in a large design effort. Setting up the 
                    Digital Mock-Up (DMU) in CATIA with a clear structure and shared file system made collaboration seamless and 
                    prevented confusion. I saw how a well-organized environment not only saves time but also builds confidence across 
                    the team, since everyone can work with the same up-to-date models. This experience reinforced the importance of 
                    structured systems in engineering projects and gave me skills I can carry forward into future collaborative work.
